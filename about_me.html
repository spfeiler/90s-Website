<h1 class="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p class="about-me">I'm 29 years old and I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. I have a B.A. in Human Development with
concentrations in Psychology and Sociology from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas. After college, my husband
and I put down roots in Houston and I began graduate work in psychology and counseling. I primarily worked with
children diagnosed with cognitive, emotional and/or behavioral disorders. After much consideration, I ultimately decided
that counseling was not the career for me. Though the need is great, I realized my true passion was elsewhere. I've put
a lot of thought into what path I want to take next, and attending a coding boot camp is something I've come back to over
and over again. It was time to take the leap and enroll in DigitalCrafts to begin my career in web development. I couldn't
be happier with my new direction in life and I am thrilled to see where the journey takes me.</p>
